- [x] **⚡ API Performance Optimization** *(✅ COMPLETED 2024-12-30)*
  - [x] **Issue**: API requests taking 4-10+ seconds, causing poor user experience and potential timeouts
  - [x] **Root Causes Identified**:
    - **Prisma Configuration**: Connection limiting and pgbouncer settings creating bottlenecks
    - **Mixed Database Clients**: Using both Supabase and Prisma for same operations causing overhead
    - **N+1 Query Problem**: Multiple separate queries instead of optimized joins
    - **Missing Database Indexes**: No indexes on commonly queried fields
    - **Inefficient Query Structure**: Complex nested queries with unnecessary data fetching
  - [x] **Solutions Implemented**:
    - **Prisma Optimization**: Removed problematic connection limits, enabled global connection reuse
    - **Query Consolidation**: Replaced multiple Supabase queries with single optimized Prisma queries
    - **Database Indexing**: Added critical indexes on orders, profiles, and game_codes tables
    - **Parallel Query Execution**: Used Promise.all for statistics queries to run in parallel
    - **Efficient Data Selection**: Only select required fields instead of fetching entire records
    - **Connection Pooling**: Implemented global Prisma instance reuse in development
  - [x] **Performance Improvements**:
    - **Admin Orders API**: Single query with includes instead of separate queries for orders, items, and stats
    - **Order Detail API**: findUnique with optimized includes instead of findFirst with complex joins

- [x] **🔥 Critical Fix: Prepared Statement Conflicts** *(✅ COMPLETED 2024-12-30)*
  - [x] **Issue**: All Prisma-based APIs failing with "prepared statement already exists" errors in development
  - [x] **Impact**: Customer /products and /orders pages completely broken, returning 500 errors
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Multiple Prisma client instances sharing prepared statements in Next.js hot reload environment
  - [x] **Solution Implemented**:
    - **Fresh Client Approach**: Created new PrismaClient instance for each API call in development
    - **Disabled Prepared Statements**: Added `?prepared_statements=false` to connection string
    - **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented proper global singleton pattern for shared client
    - **Graceful Disconnect**: Added proper client cleanup with `$disconnect()` in finally blocks
  - [x] **APIs Fixed**:

    - `/api/orders` - Properly handles authentication (401 when unauthorized)
    - All other Prisma-based endpoints should now work correctly
  - [x] **Performance**: API response times back to normal (<1 second)
  - [x] **Files Updated**:
    - `src/lib/prisma.ts` - Improved singleton pattern with global variable

## Bug Tracking

### Known Issues
- [x] **Fixed: Runtime Error - products.map is not a function** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Products page crashed with "products.map is not a function" during initial load
  - **Root Cause**: useMemo hooks were accessing `products.map()` before products state was properly initialized
  - **Solution**: Added safety checks `if (!Array.isArray(products) || products.length === 0)` in all useMemo hooks
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/products/page.tsx` - platforms, filteredAndSortedProducts, empty state, results summary
  - **Status**: ✅ Products page now loads correctly with proper loading states

- [x] **Fixed: Orders Page Stuck in Loading State** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Orders page (`/orders`) was stuck in loading state, API returning 500 Internal Server Error
  - **Root Cause**: Two issues: (1) Prisma prepared statements error due to stale client, (2) Missing `credentials: 'include'` in fetch calls
  - **Solution**: 
    - Regenerated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
    - Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch calls in `useOrders` hook
    - Restarted development server to refresh database connections
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/hooks/use-orders.ts` - added credentials to fetch calls
  - **Status**: ✅ Orders page now loads correctly with proper authentication and database connectivity

- [x] **Enhanced: Orders API Empty State Handling** *(✅ COMPLETED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: API was failing when users had no orders in database
  - **Root Cause**: Complex queries running on empty tables causing prepared statement errors
  - **Solution**: 
    - Added early return for empty orders in GET `/api/orders` endpoint
    - Enhanced error handling in orders page with proper error states
    - Added user-friendly messages for different error scenarios
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - early empty state handling
    - `src/app/orders/page.tsx` - improved error states and user feedback
  - **Status**: ✅ Orders page properly handles empty state and shows appropriate UI

- [x] **Fixed: Orders Page Infinite Loading Loop** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Orders page showing skeleton loading state forever, even when authenticated
  - **Root Cause**: useEffect dependency array included `fetchOrders` function, causing infinite re-renders
  - **Solution**: 
    - Removed `fetchOrders` from useEffect dependencies array
    - Function references from hooks change on every render, causing useEffect to run continuously
    - Only kept necessary dependencies: `currentPage`, `isAuthenticated`, `authChecked`
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/orders/page.tsx` - optimized useEffect dependencies
  - **Status**: ✅ Orders page now loads correctly without infinite re-rendering

- [x] **Fixed: Checkout Page Runtime Error** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Runtime error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'total')" on checkout page
  - **Root Cause**: Code tried to access `totals.total` but CartContext doesn't provide a `totals` object
  - **Solution**: 
    - Calculated totals directly in checkout component from cart items
    - Added subtotal, tax (8.75%), and total calculations
    - Removed dependency on non-existent `totals` property from cart state
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - local totals calculation
  - **Status**: ✅ Checkout page loads correctly with proper tax and total calculations

- [x] **Fixed: Order Creation API Error - Prisma Model Names** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Order creation failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')" and Prisma prepared statement errors
