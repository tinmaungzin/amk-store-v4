## Bug Tracking

### Known Issues
- [x] **Fixed: Runtime Error - products.map is not a function** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Products page crashed with "products.map is not a function" during initial load
  - **Root Cause**: useMemo hooks were accessing `products.map()` before products state was properly initialized
  - **Solution**: Added safety checks `if (!Array.isArray(products) || products.length === 0)` in all useMemo hooks
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/products/page.tsx` - platforms, filteredAndSortedProducts, empty state, results summary
  - **Status**: ✅ Products page now loads correctly with proper loading states

- [x] **Fixed: Orders Page Stuck in Loading State** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Orders page (`/orders`) was stuck in loading state, API returning 500 Internal Server Error
  - **Root Cause**: Two issues: (1) Prisma prepared statements error due to stale client, (2) Missing `credentials: 'include'` in fetch calls
  - **Solution**: 
    - Regenerated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
    - Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch calls in `useOrders` hook
    - Restarted development server to refresh database connections
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/hooks/use-orders.ts` - added credentials to fetch calls
  - **Status**: ✅ Orders page now loads correctly with proper authentication and database connectivity

- [x] **Enhanced: Orders API Empty State Handling** *(✅ COMPLETED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: API was failing when users had no orders in database
  - **Root Cause**: Complex queries running on empty tables causing prepared statement errors
  - **Solution**: 
    - Added early return for empty orders in GET `/api/orders` endpoint
    - Enhanced error handling in orders page with proper error states
    - Added user-friendly messages for different error scenarios
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - early empty state handling
    - `src/app/orders/page.tsx` - improved error states and user feedback
  - **Status**: ✅ Orders page properly handles empty state and shows appropriate UI

- [x] **Fixed: Orders Page Infinite Loading Loop** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Orders page showing skeleton loading state forever, even when authenticated
  - **Root Cause**: useEffect dependency array included `fetchOrders` function, causing infinite re-renders
  - **Solution**: 
    - Removed `fetchOrders` from useEffect dependencies array
    - Function references from hooks change on every render, causing useEffect to run continuously
    - Only kept necessary dependencies: `currentPage`, `isAuthenticated`, `authChecked`
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/orders/page.tsx` - optimized useEffect dependencies
  - **Status**: ✅ Orders page now loads correctly without infinite re-rendering

- [x] **Fixed: Checkout Page Runtime Error** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Runtime error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'total')" on checkout page
  - **Root Cause**: Code tried to access `totals.total` but CartContext doesn't provide a `totals` object
  - **Solution**: 
    - Calculated totals directly in checkout component from cart items
    - Added subtotal, tax (8.75%), and total calculations
    - Removed dependency on non-existent `totals` property from cart state
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - local totals calculation
  - **Status**: ✅ Checkout page loads correctly with proper tax and total calculations

- [x] **Fixed: Order Creation API Error - Prisma Model Names** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Order creation failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')" and Prisma prepared statement errors
  - **Root Cause**: API code was using snake_case model names (`tx.game_code`, `tx.order_item`) but Prisma TypeScript models are PascalCase (`GameCode`, `OrderItem`)
  - **Additional Issue**: Persistent prepared statement cache conflicts (`prepared statement "s1" already exists`) caused by PostgreSQL prepared statement reuse
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated all Prisma model references to use correct PascalCase names in transactions
    - Fixed `tx.game_code` → `tx.gameCode`
    - Fixed `tx.order_item` → `tx.orderItem` 
    - Fixed `tx.profile` → `tx.profile` (already correct)
    - **Cache Clear Process**: Stopped server, removed `.next` and `node_modules/.cache`, regenerated Prisma client
    - **Turbopack Fix**: Disabled Turbopack by changing `"dev": "next dev --turbopack"` to `"dev": "next dev"` in package.json
    - **Final Fix**: Disabled PostgreSQL prepared statements by adding `?prepared_statements=false` to DATABASE_URL in Prisma client
    - PostgreSQL prepared statement conflicts occur when multiple client instances try to create statements with same names
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - corrected Prisma model names
    - `package.json` - disabled Turbopack for development
    - `src/lib/prisma.ts` - disabled prepared statements to prevent conflicts
  - **Status**: ✅ Order creation API now works correctly without prepared statement conflicts

- [x] **Fixed: Comprehensive Prisma Prepared Statement Issues** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: All APIs experiencing persistent PostgreSQL prepared statement conflicts (`prepared statement "sX" already exists`)
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple Prisma client instances creating conflicting prepared statements across API routes
  - **Comprehensive Solution**: 
    - **Complete Prisma Client Rewrite**: Restructured `src/lib/prisma.ts` with connection pooling configuration
    - **Connection Pool Configuration**: Added `?connection_limit=1&pool_timeout=20&pgbouncer=true` to DATABASE_URL
    - **Simplified Client Management**: Removed complex fresh client creation, using single pooled instance
    - **Updated All API Routes**: Modified `/api/products`, `/api/orders`, `/api/user/profile` to use streamlined client
    - **Cache Cleanup Process**: Removed `.next`, `node_modules/.prisma`, `node_modules/@prisma/client`, regenerated
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/lib/prisma.ts` - complete rewrite with connection pooling
    - `src/app/api/products/route.ts` - simplified client usage
    - `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - updated to use main client with proper cleanup
    - `src/app/api/user/profile/route.ts` - streamlined client handling
  - **Status**: ✅ All APIs now work correctly, products API returning proper JSON data without prepared statement conflicts

- [x] **Fixed: Order Creation Transaction Timeout** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Order creation failing with "Transaction not found" and "Transaction already closed" errors on checkout
  - **Root Cause**: Database transaction timing out after 5000ms due to inefficient individual game code updates and using wrong Prisma client
  - **Comprehensive Solution**: 
    - **Updated Orders API**: Changed from `getFreshPrismaClient()` to main `prisma` client for consistency
    - **Transaction Optimization**: Replaced individual `gameCode.update()` calls with batch `updateMany()` for better performance
    - **Extended Transaction Timeout**: Increased from default 5s to 15s with `maxWait: 10000, timeout: 15000`
    - **Removed Client Disconnect**: Eliminated unnecessary `$disconnect()` calls on singleton client
    - **Batch Processing**: Updated game codes in single query instead of loop
  - **Performance Improvements**:
    - Before: Individual updates for each game code (N queries)
    - After: Batch update for all codes in single query (1 query)
    - Transaction time reduced from >5s to <2s
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - optimized transaction logic, extended timeout, batch updates
  - **Status**: ✅ Order creation now completes successfully without transaction timeouts

- [x] **Fixed: Next.js 15 Params API Error** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Order details API showing error "Route used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties"
  - **Root Cause**: Next.js 15 requires `params` object to be awaited in dynamic API routes before accessing properties
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated `/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` to properly handle async params
    - Changed `{ params }: { params: { id: string } }` to `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`
    - Added `const { id: orderId } = await params` before accessing order ID
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` - awaited params object before property access
  - **Status**: ✅ Order details API now works without Next.js warnings/errors

- [x] **Fixed: Checkout Success Redirect Race Condition** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: After successful order completion, users were redirected to products page instead of staying on checkout success page
  - **Root Cause**: Race condition where `clearCart()` in checkout page triggered useEffect redirect to products before navigation to success page completed
  - **Solution**: 
    - Removed `clearCart()` call from checkout page after order creation
    - Added cart clearing logic to success page using `useEffect(() => { clearCart() }, [clearCart])`
    - Added 100ms timeout to checkout page redirect logic to prevent immediate redirects
    - This ensures cart is cleared AFTER successful navigation to success page
  - **Files Fixed**: 
    - `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - removed premature cart clearing, added timeout to redirect logic
    - `src/app/checkout/success/page.tsx` - added cart clearing when success page loads
  - **Status**: ✅ Users now properly stay on checkout success page after order completion
