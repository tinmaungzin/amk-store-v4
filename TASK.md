  - **Root Cause**: useMemo hooks were accessing `products.map()` before products state was properly initialized
  - **Solution**: Added safety checks `if (!Array.isArray(products) || products.length === 0)` in all useMemo hooks
  - **Files Fixed**: `src/app/products/page.tsx` - platforms, filteredAndSortedProducts, empty state, results summary
  - **Status**: ✅ Products page now loads correctly with proper loading states

- [x] **Fixed: Orders Page Stuck in Loading State** *(✅ RESOLVED 2024-12-30)*
  - **Issue**: Orders page (`/orders`) was stuck in loading state, API returning 500 Internal Server Error
  - **Root Cause**: Two issues: (1) Prisma prepared statements error due to stale client, (2) Missing `credentials: 'include'` in fetch calls
  - **Solution**: 
    - Regenerated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
    - Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch calls in `useOrders` hook
    - Restarted development server to refresh database connections

  - [x] **Issue Resolved**: User reported cart drawer appearing immediately without smooth slide animation like the hamburger menu

  - [x] **Solution Implemented**:
    - **Always Render Approach**: Changed cart drawer to always be rendered in the DOM, positioned off-screen when closed
    - **CSS Transform Animation**: Cart now uses `translate-x-full` when closed and `translate-x-0` when open for smooth sliding
    - **Proper Pointer Events**: Added `pointer-events-auto` when open and `pointer-events-none` when closed for correct interaction behavior
    - **Consistent Animation Timing**: Both cart and navigation drawers now use identical 300ms `ease-in-out` transitions

- [x] **🔑 Authentication State Update Fix** *(✅ COMPLETED 2024-12-30)*
  - [x] **Issue Resolved**: User reported needing to manually refresh page after login to see updated UI for logged-in user
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Server action redirects don't automatically trigger client-side authentication state updates in the useUser hook
  - [x] **Problem Analysis**:
    - **Server-Side Login**: Original implementation used server actions with `redirect()` which bypassed client-side state management
    - **State Synchronization**: The `useUser` hook wasn't being notified of authentication changes from server actions
    - **UI Lag**: Components remained in "logged out" state until manual page refresh triggered re-evaluation
  - [x] **Solution Implemented**:
    - **Client-Side Authentication**: Switched login form to use client-side Supabase authentication via `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`

  - [x] **Testing**: Login now instantly updates UI without requiring manual page refresh, maintaining all role-based navigation features

- [x] **🔑 Logout Authentication State Update Fix** *(✅ COMPLETED 2024-12-30)*
  - [x] **Issue Resolved**: Similar to login, logout required manual page refresh to update UI from logged-in to logged-out state
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Logout was using server action `logout()` with `redirect()` which bypassed client-side authentication state management
  - [x] **Problem Analysis**:
    - **Server-Side Logout**: Original implementation used server action which didn't trigger `useUser` hook updates
    - **State Synchronization**: UI components remained in "logged in" state until manual page refresh
    - **Navigation Issues**: User dropdown and authentication-dependent components showed stale state
  - [x] **Solution Implemented**:
    - **Client-Side Logout**: Switched to `supabase.auth.signOut()` for immediate client-side state updates

    - **Enhanced Accessibility**: Improved interactive feedback across all menu items
    - **Error Recovery**: Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
  - [x] **File Updated**: `src/components/shared/user-nav.tsx` - Complete rewrite from server action to client-side logout with automatic state management
  - [x] **Testing**: Logout now instantly updates UI without requiring manual page refresh, providing seamless authentication experience
